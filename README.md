Future plan if I continue this project:
- Finish combatant card database
- Backup png, change all image to webp to improve speed
- Impliment ladder count
- Add redo button
- Add cookie to remember preset team and so you don't have to manual select combatant everytime
- Live calcuation on hover button shat show how much points will be added
- Add current points of each card
- Add neutral card database
- Scale down and fix layout size. Make 3 layout viewable in 1280x720p
- Mobile friendly/super condense layout

**Expansion**
- Div screen into half, so you can view possible acquireable item/card, and event choice in the current chaos world.
- At items target and how to get them
- Deck builder: update database including epiphany variation and divine epiphany, add target card at the same line with target item
